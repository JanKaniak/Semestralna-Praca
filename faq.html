  <div class="FAQtext"><p><b>Why Early Access?</b></p>
  <p>We're releasing our game in Early Access because we believe there's still much more to offer. While we're proud of what we've built so far, we're not fully satisfied with the current content and gameplay variety. Early Access allows us to gather feedback from players and ensure that we can add more features, expand the content, and provide multiple ways to enjoy the game. We want to create the best possible experience, and the input from our community will play a big part in shaping the final version.</p>
  <p><b>Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?</b></p>
  <p>We plan to keep the game in Early Access for approximately 2 more years. This timeframe will allow us to continue refining the game, adding new content, and incorporating feedback from our players to ensure the final release meets our high standards for quality and enjoyment.</p>
  <p><b>How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?</b></p>
  <p>The full version of the game is planned to include a variety of enhancements and additions compared to the Early Access version. This will include new gameplay features, additional levels and environments, improved graphics and animations, and more diverse challenges. We also aim to integrate community feedback to refine existing content and mechanics, ensuring a more polished and engaging experience. Our goal is to deliver a richer, more immersive game that expands on the foundations laid during Early Access.</p>
  <p><b>What is the current state of the Early Access version?</b></p>
  <p>The current state of the Early Access version features one available mode for players to enjoy.</p>
  <p><b>Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?</b></p>
  <p>Yes, we plan to increase the price of the game to â‚¬30 once it is fully released. This price adjustment will reflect the additional content, features, and improvements that will be available in the final version. We want to ensure that players receive a quality experience that justifies the increase.</p>
  <p><b>How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?</b></p>
  <p>Our team is committed to actively listening to our community through various channels, including our Discord server, Twitter, and YouTube comments. We value player feedback and input, as it plays a crucial role in shaping the game's development. In the near future, we also plan to organize surveys to gather more structured feedback from our players, ensuring that their voices are heard in the development process.</p>
